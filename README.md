## Description

I've been looking for ways to take quick notes that I can use in my current workflow for a while. Although I tried a few applications, I couldn't find a faster way than opening an editor and writing something, but it's quite difficult to organize this process, so I'm developing Not. to make it easier to take notes for myself.
